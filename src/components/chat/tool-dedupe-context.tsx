/**
 * ToolDedupeContext — cross-message dedup cursor. Ported from Hindsight
 * components/agent/tool-dedupe-context.tsx.
 *
 * The chain-of-thought grouping only sees a single message's content parts.
 * When the agent makes the same tool call twice across TWO assistant
 * messages (e.g. a second read of the same place after reasoning between
 * turns), each message renders its own row and you end up with two
 * identical "Reading what people say about Via Carota" lines stacked next to
 * each other.
 *
 * This context provides a shared mutable cursor that each message's grouping
 * pass reads + updates during render. React renders components top-down, so
 * by the time message N+1 renders, the cursor holds the last key from
 * message N. If it matches, message N+1 skips that part.
 *
 * The cursor is reset at the start of every render of the provider
 * (which wraps the Thread). This is intentionally impure — refs + render
 * order — but it works because a thread's message list renders in order
 * and we only need "was the PREVIOUS tool call identical."
